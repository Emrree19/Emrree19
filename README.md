- 👋 Hi, I’m Emre Ornekol
- I studied computer programming at a vocational high school. I started coding during my high school years. During this time, I learned C# and, in addition to basic programming, 
-I also dealt with database connections and SQL. After graduating from high school, I completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Programming at Istanbul University. I did my internships in a company that 
-develops ERP software. There, I further developed my skills in SQL and database connections. After completing my associate degree, I transitioned to Industrial Engineering through the DGS. As part of the 
-Enterprise Resource Planning course, I learned Uyumsoft ERP and Harmony ERP systems and obtained a certificate. I also improved my programming skills through programming courses.
